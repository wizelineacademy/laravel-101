# Laravel 101

Code repository for the material shown in the Laravel 101 Workshop

## Installation and setup

1. Clone the repository to your desired path with

```
git clone https://github.com/wizelineacademy/laravel-101.git
```
2. Install all the dependencies with Composer

```
composer install
```

3. Setup your favorite local development server. In my case I prefer to use Homestead (Information and instructions on how to setup - https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/homestead). Point your webserver to the `public` folder located in the root of your project.

4. Start the server and explore the app in the `main` branch. If you wish to work with the project from an empty boilerplate you can check the `kickoff` branch out and work on it as you wish. Both branches use the same `composer.json` file, you don't need to do run the dependencies installation command again.
